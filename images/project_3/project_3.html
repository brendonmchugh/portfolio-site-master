              <h3 style="text-align: center;">Shapes</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Shapes is a vector image of rectangular items and it is a green palet. I made 
            this because it was an assignment to make a vector drawing with some sort of theme.
          After that we painted this design on a board. I chose an all green theme since at the time
        it was starting to be spring and I wanted to do something that could remind me of time of year. </p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">Room Layout was a project where we had to make a system
                   that would help us organize 100 different items easilly. This image is layput of my closet. 
                  I organized all the clothing by the actual location they are in my closet. Everything is also sorted by
                what season I would wear the article of clothing.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">Flag Day 5k was a project/competition where we had to make designs that would be 
                  put on t-shirts for all the runners. The design had certain criteria with what has to be on the design were, Flag Day 5k, benefits the FEF, and Falmouth.
                  I chose to design the three runners the way I did because I wanted them to represent 1st, 2nd, 3rd place. The American flag is there because the theme of the 
                design and race was America themed.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">Beginner Level Logo was a project where I had to make a poster for the freshen in High school
                  to see when they do there first year in the class. This was a project the teacher gave only a few people and she had us all do 
                  different levels of the class. There were only four levels so four kids from each level of Graphic Design were given a class level 
                  and then the class that had designs made for them would vote on the best one. In this work I decided to keep it simple and type
                  big bold "FHS Graphic Design" that was because the schools Name was Falmouth High School(FHS). I wanted to have the photoshop icon in
                  the corner because in graphic design level one that is the only program you used. I also had the maroon circle in the back because 
                  that was the schools color </p>

                              <h3 style="text-align: center;">Class Banner</h3>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">Class Banner was for the  whole Grpahic Design classroom. Since we only had one classroom I decided to make the four programs that we end up using throughout the
                  four levels of the class.I made each one of the programs using the square tool and then normal letters. I also made the Apple desktop computer since that was also
                the only kind of computer we ended up using in the class. </p>

                                  <h3 style="text-align: center;">LJ Shoe</h3>
                  <p style="text-align: center;">LJ Shoe was a vector drawing/tracing of my long jump shoe for track. This was a class assignment where we had to choose
                  an item that had a special meaning to us and I chose these shoes because they remind me of the thing I love to do which is track. In this project 
                the goal was to trace in item using the pen tool as best you can and try to capture what the item does with minimal words. Because these are Long Jump soes they are meant to help you in long jump
              which means helping you just slightly higher while also going farther. These shoes are also one of the best shoes out currently which is why I put "JUMP SMARTER" since it 
            the best option for any jumper. Then in the bottom right corner I put the name of the shoes and the year they were made.</p>.

                  <p style="text-align: center;">Night Life is a vector image of a city at night time. In this image I added a few different things, I added
                  buildings, a helicopter, a car, some lights and some smaller items. In the sky I have a helicopter made using the pen tool. The reason for making this piece was because 
                I had just seen a helicopter go over my neighborhood one night and I had gone to the city earlier that same day. I ended up basing the image in a 
              city suburb at night with a helicopter going around looking for something with its light.</p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">Run Jack Run was a class project but also a competition for a t-shirt design. When wokring on this project there were
                  a few requirements that included having "8th Annual Run Jack Run" and the year. This project was for a race which is why I included all the 
                figures running and a finishline.  </p>

                  <p style="text-align: center;">Armour was a project where we had to create our own brand new company. Armour was the company I came up with and this was the logo design for the company.
                  I decided to go for a different aproach than just normally typing out the words, instead I decided it would be best if I sort of outlined the letters but 
                only enough to be able to tell what the letter is supposed to be. This company was ment to a vegan healthy choice to eating a protein bar before or after a workout btuthe catch
              was you were eating natural ingredients.</p>
