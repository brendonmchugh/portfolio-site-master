            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Clarendon URW</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Clarendon URW was an assignment to create a total of eight pages. In this project the point
              was to give the history of the font. For the first piece I ended up using one of my other 
              projects I did with the same font, that was the cover pages. After that I then added a theme 
              to each of the pages but I followed a similar layout for the text throughout the whole book. On the third page I
              made it a brithsh themed page because it went with the history of the font. For the next few slides I wanted to 
              show different examples about the text in different contexts. On the last page before the back cover I 
            put a wanted poster of the creater of Clarendon</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">John Holladay was a biography of his artwork. John Holladay used to be my first graphic design teacher
            so I chose to make this project about him. The project was to pick a know artist and put their work and a little information about them into a book.
          The book is mainly made up of Holladays most accomplished and recognized work out there.  </p>
