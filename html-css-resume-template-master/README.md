Reorder and rename sections to make this your own. Don't forget to change
or remove *all* the template text. It would be embarassing if someone thought
you *really* worked as a Squirrel Chaser, fun as that would be.

Pagebreaks
==========

Manually place pagebreaks by putting the line::

    <div class="pagebreak"></div>

in the appropriate place in `resume.html`.

Fonts
=====

You may need to replace the fonts specified in `resume.css` depending on
what's available on your system.

Thanks!

I am by no stretch an HTML or CSS expert so, if you are, feel free to improve
on this by forking and submitting a pull request. I like the style of this
resume, though, so if you want to significantly restyle the template it would
be best to make a separate HTML and CSS files. It would be great if we could
get a selection of templates in here.
